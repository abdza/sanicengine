Welcome to SanicEngine's documentation!
***************************************

SanicEngine is great. SanicEngine is a web application framework which I have written to make my life as a web application developer a little easier. It uses the awesome Sanic web server as a base and so it's built to be fast. You can clone or download SanicEngine from it's github page.

Check out our get :ref:`getting-started` page to get your feet wet. Or if you're not ready to download and setup on your own rig yet, come and try the demo at http://demo.sanicengine.com. It still uses the default username and password which is just admin and admin123.
